#### INSTRUCTIONS

There are three files,
 * One for creating your tables
 * Another for data (already created for you)
 * One for your queries


To create your tables, run:

	sqlite3 firstdb.db < tables.mdf

To enter the data as records into your database:

    sqlite3 firstdb.db < data.mdf

To run your queries, enter:

	sqlite3 firstdb.db < school.mdf




## TO DO:

1. Create your Tables
Look at the data to see what fields are needed for the data to fit in the tables At minimum, should have a table for: Schools, Teachers, Classes, Students

2. After the tables have been created, run the data to enter records into the tables.  All the data has already been created for you, so you should only have to run this file. 
⋅⋅*If you run into any errors, that means you'll need to make changes to your tables

3. Start making queries! 
⋅⋅* Show the names of all the classes that are currently have students enrolled
